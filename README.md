## Installation

You can download the latest version of this application for MacOS, Windows, and Linux on the [releases page](https://github.com/beyondcode/laravel-debugbar-companion/releases).

There is currently an [open PR](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar/pull/1141) on the Laravel DebugBar repository, that explains how to connect the Laravel DebugBar with the companion app.

### Contributing

To get the application running locally, first install all required dependencies using `yarn`.

The application can be started in development mode using:

```
yarn electron:serve
```

This will start the application in a hot-reloading mode, so all changes will be immediately visible within the application.
